# RWX Skills

Skills for working with [RWX](https://www.rwx.com).

## Requirements

The `rwx` CLI must be on your PATH. Install it from
[RWX docs](https://www.rwx.com/docs/rwx/getting-started/installing-the-cli).

## Available Skills

### rwx

Generates or modifies an RWX CI/CD config by analyzing project structure,
selecting appropriate packages, and producing an optimized config with DAG
parallelism, content-based caching, and RWX packages. If an existing
`.rwx/*.yml` config is present, modifies it in place.

Usage: invoke with an optional description, e.g. "CI pipeline with tests and
deploy" or "add a deploy step with secrets"

### Migration Skills

#### migrate-from-gha

Migrates a GitHub Actions workflow to an optimized RWX config.

Usage: invoke with a path to a GitHub Actions workflow file, e.g.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`

#### review-gha-migration

Reviews a generated RWX config against the original GitHub Actions workflow to
catch semantic gaps, missing steps, and optimization opportunities.

Usage: invoke with a path to an RWX config file, e.g. `.rwx/ci.yml`

## Validation

After writing or modifying RWX config files (`.rwx/*.yml`), validate them by
running:

    rwx lint .rwx/<name>.yml

## Skill Procedures

Full step-by-step procedures are in the `skills/` directory:

- `skills/migrate-from-gha/SKILL.md`
- `skills/review-gha-migration/SKILL.md`
- `skills/rwx/SKILL.md`

Each skill's SKILL.md includes `rwx docs pull` commands for fetching the latest
RWX documentation directly. Do NOT use WebFetch for these — use Bash to run
`rwx docs pull` and read stdout. When you need to find documentation beyond the
references listed in a skill procedure, use `rwx docs search "<query>"` to
discover the right page, then `rwx docs pull` to read it.
