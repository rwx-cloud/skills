  Migrate a GitHub Actions workflow to RWX. Translates triggers, jobs, steps
  into an optimized RWX config with DAG parallelism, content-based caching, and
  RWX packages.

## Migration Procedure

You are migrating a GitHub Actions workflow to RWX. Follow these steps exactly.
Do NOT use TodoWrite — this procedure is your task list.

### Step 1: Read and analyze the source workflow

Read the GitHub Actions workflow file at `$ARGUMENTS`. If no path is provided,
look for `.github/workflows/` and list the available workflow files for the user
to choose from.

Identify all jobs and their `needs:` dependencies, all steps within each job,
triggers (`on:` events), secrets referenced (`${{ secrets.* }}`), environment
variables (`env:` blocks at workflow, job, and step level), matrix strategies,
services, composite action references, reusable workflow calls, artifact
upload/download steps, and cache steps (these will be removed — RWX handles
caching natively).

For steps using `uses: ./.github/actions/foo`, read that action's `action.yml`
and inline its logic into the translated RWX config. For cross-repo references
(`uses: org/repo@ref`), add a `# TODO:` comment explaining what the action does
and that the user needs to translate it manually or find an RWX package
equivalent.

Tell the user what you found: how many jobs, the dependency graph between them,
which triggers are configured, which composite actions you inlined, and which
cross-repo references will need TODO comments. Keep it brief.

Then write a migration inventory to `.rwx/.migration-inventory.md`. This file is
a structured checklist that will be used during the review step to verify
nothing was dropped. Keep it compact — names and keys only, not full details:

```markdown
## Jobs

- lint (needs: [])
- test (needs: [])
- build (needs: [lint, test])
- deploy (needs: [build], if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main')

## Secrets

- DEPLOY_TOKEN

## Environment Variables

- DATABASE_URL (job: test)

## Services

- postgres (job: test)

## Matrix Strategies

- go-version: [1.22, 1.26] (job: test)

## Notable Steps

- golangci-lint-action (job: lint)
- upload-artifact coverage.out (job: test)
- download-artifact app-binary (job: deploy)
```

Omit any sections that have no entries.

### Step 2: Write the optimized RWX config

Fetch the full reference documentation now. Do NOT use WebFetch — it summarizes
and drops critical details. Instead, use Bash to curl each doc and read the
stdout directly. Run all three in a single turn as parallel Bash calls:

- `curl -sL https://www.rwx.com/docs/rwx/migrating/gha-cheat-sheet.md` — action-to-package mapping and DAG pattern (read this first)
- `curl -sL https://www.rwx.com/docs/rwx/migrating/rwx-reference.md` — full RWX config syntax
- `curl -sL https://www.rwx.com/docs/rwx/migrating/gha-reference.md` — GHA-to-RWX concept mapping

This is the core of the migration. Do NOT produce a 1:1 mapping. Apply the
optimization rules from the reference documentation — including DAG
decomposition, content-based caching, package substitution, trigger mapping,
secret mapping, and environment variable translation.

Write the generated RWX config to `.rwx/<name>.yml`, where `<name>` is derived
from the source workflow filename (e.g., `ci.github.yml` → `.rwx/ci.yml`).

Structure the file in this order:

1. `on:` triggers
2. `base:` image and config
3. `tool-cache:` (if needed)
4. `tasks:` array, ordered by DAG level (independent tasks first, then their
   dependents)

After writing the file, validate the generated config:

    rwx lint .rwx/<name>.yml

If there are diagnostics, fix the issues and re-check until the file is clean.
You can also initiate test runs locally without pushing the code — see
`rwx run --help` for documentation.

### Step 3: Review and summarize

Tell the user: "Now reviewing the migration to check for gaps."

Re-read `.rwx/.migration-inventory.md` (written in Step 1) and the generated RWX
config. Use the inventory as your checklist — verify every item in it is
accounted for in the config. This is more reliable than working from memory of
the source workflow.

Then follow the review procedure from
[review-gha-migration/SKILL.md](../review-gha-migration/SKILL.md). You already
have the reference docs from Step 2 — do not re-fetch them.

If the review found blocking issues, fix them before continuing.

Then provide a final summary to the user that covers both the migration and the
review:

- What the original workflow did
- How the RWX version is structured differently (and why it's better)
- The DAG shape: which tasks run in parallel vs sequentially
- The review verdict and any issues found (or confirmation that it passed)
- Any `# TODO:` items that need manual attention
- Secrets that need to be configured in RWX Cloud
- Estimated parallelism improvement (e.g., "6 sequential steps → 3-level DAG")

Let the user know they can re-run the review independently at any time with
`/rwx:review-gha-migration`.
